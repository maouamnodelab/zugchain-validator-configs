## � Critical: Network & Firewall

Before installing **ANYTHING**, you **MUST** open specific network ports. If these ports are closed, your node will have **zero peers** and will fail to synchronize with the blockchain.

You need to open these ports on your **Operating System Firewall** (e.g., `ufw` on Ubuntu) AND your **Cloud Provider's Firewall** (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Vultr Firewall rules).

| Port | Protocol | Service | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **30303** | `TCP` & `UDP` | Execution (Geth) | P2P Peering (Required for Sync) |
| **13000** | `TCP` | Consensus (Beacon) | P2P Peering (Required for Attestations) |
| **12000** | `UDP` | Consensus (Beacon) | P2P Discovery (Required for Sync) |
| **3500** | `TCP` | API (Lighthouse) | API (Required for Validator) |

### Quick Firewall Setup (Ubuntu UFW)

If you are using `ufw` on Ubuntu, copy and paste these commands one by one to configure your firewall correctly:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 30303
```
```bash
sudo ufw allow 13000/tcp
```
```bash
sudo ufw allow 3500/tcp
```
```bash
sudo ufw allow 12000/udp
```
```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup Guide

> [!WARNING]
> **Clean Machine Required!**  
> Do **NOT** install this on a server that is already running an Ethereum Mainnet Validator node (or any other network). Doing so can cause severe file conflicts, database corruption, and lead to your ETH node malfunctioning. Unless you are a highly experienced DevOps engineer, you **must** use a fresh, clean Linux installation for your ZugChain Validator.

> [!NOTE]
> **Fully Automated Setup**
> You **ONLY** need to install `geth` manually (Step 1). The rest of the process is fully automated. Our initialization script (`join_network.sh`) automatically handles downloading and configuring all custom ZugChain consensus binaries. No other manual software installations or external downloads are required!

Follow these simple steps in order. Take your time and make sure each step completes successfully before moving to the next one.

### Step 1: Install Geth (Execution Client)

Before doing anything else, your Linux machine needs `geth` installed. Geth is the software that executes the smart contracts on the blockchain.

Add the official Ethereum repository:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum
```

Update your package lists:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Install the Ethereum package:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ethereum -y
```

**Verify the Installation:**
Ensure `geth` was installed correctly by checking its version. It should return version details without any errors.
```bash
geth version
```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Next, download this automated setup repository to your server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZugChainLabs/zugchain-validator-configs.git
```

Move into the downloaded directory:
```bash
cd zugchain-validator-configs
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Node

Now, you will run the initialization script. This script automatically configures the execution and consensus clients based on your server's hardware.

Navigate to the `validator` folder:
```bash
cd validator
```

Grant execution permissions to the script:
```bash
chmod +x join_network.sh
```

Run the script with administrator privileges:
```bash
sudo ./join_network.sh
```

## 🔐 Key Management & Activation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Official Deposit Contract:** The ONLY official ZugChain Beacon Deposit Contract address is `0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa`. Always verify this exact address before sending funds!

To earn rewards and participate in the network, you must generate validator keys and import them. The system needs these keys in a special encrypted wallet.

### Step 1: Generate Keys

You must generate your keys securely using the official CLI.

1. Go to the [ZugChain Deposit CLI Tool](https://github.com/ZugChainLabs/zugchain-deposit-cli).
2. Follow their instructions to generate your validator keys.
3. Keep the generated `keystore-m...json` file and the **password** you used for it very safe.

### Step 2: Transfer Keys to the Server

You need to put your `keystore` file and your password onto your Linux server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The exact filename of your keystore will look something like `keystore-m_12381_3600_0_0_0-1771503650.json`. Always use your actual filename.

Create a folder for your keys:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/zug_keys
```

**Choose ONE method to put your keys on the server:**

<details>
<summary><b>Option A: Copy & Paste via Terminal (Simplest)</b></summary>

Open a new empty file in the terminal, using the **EXACT name** of your generated keystore file:
```bash
nano ~/zug_keys/keystore-m_...json
```
*(Replace `keystore-m_...json` with your actual filename! Paste the contents of your physical keystore file inside. Then press `Ctrl+O`, hit `Enter` to save, and press `Ctrl+X` to exit.)*

Create your password file:
```bash
echo "YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD" > ~/zug_keys/password.txt
```
*(Make sure to replace `YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` with your actual password!)*

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option B: File Transfer (Advanced)</b></summary>

Use SFTP or SCP to directly upload your `keystore-m_...json` file into the `~/zug_keys` directory on your server.

Then create your password file:
```bash
echo "YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD" > ~/zug_keys/password.txt
```
</details>

### Step 3: Import the Keys (Crucial Step)

Now, you will import the uploaded keys into the validator's secure wallet. **Do not skip this!**

Run this exact command (adjusting the filename if you uploaded it directly):
```bash
/usr/local/bin/validator accounts import \
    --keys-dir=$HOME/zug_keys \
    --wallet-dir=/opt/zugchain/data/validators \
    --account-password-file=$HOME/zug_keys/password.txt
```

**During this process:**
1. The terminal will ask you to create a **NEW Wallet Password**. (This can be the same or different from your keystore password).
2. **IMMEDIATELY** save this new wallet password to your server, so your validator can start automatically after reboots:

```bash
echo "YOUR_NEW_WALLET_PASSWORD" > /opt/zugchain/data/validators/wallet-password.txt
```

> [!CAUTION]
> If you fail to save the `wallet-password.txt` file exactly as shown above, your Validator service will fail to restart automatically and will display a "No accounts found" error.

### Step 4: Start the Validator Service

With your keys imported and password saved, you can officially start participating!

```bash
sudo systemctl start zugchain-validator
```

## 🛠️ Operations & Monitoring

It is your responsibility to keep your node online. Prolonged downtime can result in slashing penalties.

### Checking Service Status

Make sure everything is running smoothly with these commands:

Check the **Execution Layer (Geth)**:
```bash
systemctl status zugchain-geth
```

Check the **Consensus Layer (Beacon Chain)**:
```bash
systemctl status zugchain-beacon
```

Check the **Validator Client**:
```bash
systemctl status zugchain-validator
```

*(Press `Q` on your keyboard to exit the status screen).*

### Viewing Live Logs

Logs help you see what the node is doing right now in real-time. First, install `ccze` to colorize and format the logs:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ccze -y
```

Watch **Geth Logs**:
```bash
journalctl -fu zugchain-geth | ccze -A
```

Watch **Beacon Chain Logs** (Use this to check your Sync Status and Peer Count):
```bash
journalctl -fu zugchain-beacon | ccze -A
```

Watch **Validator Logs** (Use this to check if you are Attesting correctly):
```bash
journalctl -fu zugchain-validator | ccze -A
```

*(Press `Ctrl+C` to stop watching the logs).*

### Restarting the Entire Stack

If you make changes or need to refresh the whole node, run this combined restart command:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart zugchain-geth zugchain-beacon zugchain-validator
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### 1. "I have 0 Peers" or my peer count is very low
* Your firewall is almost certainly blocking connections.
* Double-check that ports **30303** (TCP/UDP), **13000** (TCP), **12000** (UDP), and **3500** (TCP) are open on **both** Ubuntu `ufw` AND your cloud provider's web dashboard.

### 2. "Genesis Hash Mismatch" Error
* This means your configuration files are outdated compared to the rest of the network.
* **Fix**: Pull the latest code by running `git pull` from the `zugchain-validator-configs` directory, then re-run the `join_network.sh` script.

### 3. Sync Warnings in Beacon or Validator Logs
During the initial synchronization process, you might see warning or error messages in your logs. This is perfectly normal! The validator and beacon node cannot do their jobs until the blockchain history is fully downloaded.

* **In Beacon Logs:** You might see `WARN execution: Execution client is not syncing` or `ERROR execution: Beacon node is not respecting the follow distance. EL client is syncing. lastBlockNumber=0`
* **In Validator Logs:** You might see `WARN fallback: No responsive beacon node found tried=[127.0.0.1:4000]` or `Waiting for beacon chain to sync`

**Action:** Just be patient and wait for the sync to complete. Keep an eye on the beacon logs (`journalctl -fu zugchain-beacon | ccze -A`). Once the sync reaches 100%, your validator will automatically start working and these messages will disappear.

### 4. Still Having Issues?
* First, please **re-read this entire guide from the beginning meticulously.** Most issues arise from missed steps or typos.
